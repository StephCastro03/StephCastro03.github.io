    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Stephanie Castro! I'm a senior at Ralston Valley High School and also attending Warren Tech in the Computer Science program. I'm really passionate about where tech is heading, especially in the world of digital forensics, and that’s the career path I’m aiming for.</p>
    <p>I also have past experience in forensics at Warren Tech! My interest in digital forensics is what got me into computer science in the first place.</p>
    <p>I am currently learning Python and I am helping build an AI-powered diagnostic tool for the NASA HUNCH Program. I am always looking for new ways to grow as a problem solver and as a developer.</p>
